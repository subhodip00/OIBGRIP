And then he said to me that dreams are only dreams, that's a privilegy of the rich people. I have grown up now and my dream came true, but I feel sad that my father can't see that and what I have reached in my life. But I know he's watching me from the sky" - <sub>Cristiano Ronaldo</sub></em></blockquote>
